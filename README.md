Iterate Clojure Introduction Workshop 2012
==========================================

A practical, hands-on introduction into programming Clojure, the best JVM language ever :-)

Preparation before the workshop
-------------------------------

To get all the tools you will need ready, execute the attached script (you might want to check/modify it if you already have Leiningen or Catnip installed):

    bash$ source prepare_all.sh

It will

* Download and initialize the latest Leiningen 2 (Clojure build tool)
* Leiningen will download Clojure 1.4.0
* It will download and start Catnip, the leightweight in-browse Clojure IDE;
    * Catnip should start a browser, if it doesn't, upon the URL printed.
    * In Catnip, type f.ex. `(println "hello")` and press Control-E to evaluate it to see that all is working
    * Press Control-C in the console to stop Catnip

Congratulations! You are now ready for the workshop.
